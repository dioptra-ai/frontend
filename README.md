# Frontend

## Development

One time setup: install the commit hook with
```
npm run prepare
```

See the main repo for how to develop this service: https://github.com/dioptra-ai/lakeml#readme

NOTE: The frontend is automatically rebuilt (client) or restarted (server) when saving a file located under `src/`.
